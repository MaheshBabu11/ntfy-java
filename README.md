Java library for publishing/recieving message from a [ntfy](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) server.

ntfy (pronounce: notify) is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. It allows you to send notifications to your 
phone or desktop via scripts from any computer, entirely without signup, cost or setup. Itâ€™s also open source if you want 
to run your own. Visit ntfy.sh for more details.

ntfy-java is a java wrapper for this service.The workflow is to replicate the GET/POST calls to ntfy based servers and 
provide a neat way to create a client/streaming service to send/receive notifications.
